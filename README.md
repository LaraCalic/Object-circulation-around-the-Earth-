** An example of gravitational law, where the calculation was done, for a object that moves around the Earth **

The example demonstrates how some object, with preditermined initial conditions on velocity, mass, and momentum moves around the Earth on circular orbit. 
After calculation the period of a object, we can plot orbital period as a function of radius.
